        <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
	    <p>
		Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) occurs when there is a discrepency with the brain's ability to process sensory information both internally and/or from the environment and then respond correctly to the environment. Students may exhibit a variety of behaviors ranging form excessive movement, emotional self regulation difficulties, and avoidance of enjoyable activities.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is important to note that we all have varying responses to sensory information around us. SPD only occurs when our responses affect our ability to complete activities of daily living or engage in work and play activities. The disorder is usually identified through an occupational therapy evaluation which often consists of a behavioral checklist and observations.

	   <h2 id="smd">SENSORY MODULATION DISORDER</h2>
	   
       <P>Sensory modulation disorder occurs in students when they incorrectly respond to sensory input in their environment based on how the interpert this input. Responses are divided into three catagories and students in each category exhibit the following behaviors:</P>

	       <div class="column1of3">
		      <h3>OVER RESPONSIVITY</h3>
               
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoids crowds or noise places</li>
                    <li>Bothered by clothes and tags</li>
                    <li>Picky eating</li>
                    <li>Severe car sickness</li>
                </ul>

	       <div class="column2of3">
		      <h3>UNDER RESPONSIVITY</h3>

    		  <ul>
                <li>Doesn't respond to name being called</li>
                <li>Doesn't feel pain or notice when bumps into objects</li>
                <li>Unaware of soilded clothing or food around the mouth</li>

	   <h2 id="sbmd">SENSORY BASED MOVEMENT DISORDER</h2>
	   
        <p>
        Sensory based motor disorder relates to difficulties in movement and engaging in activities due to incoordination. Movement difficulties are not related to brain injuries, muscle weakness or congenital conditions such as Cerebral Palsey. This subsection is divided into the following two areas:
        </p>
	
	       <div class="column1of2">
		      
                <h3>DYSPRAXIA</h3>
		  
                <p>
                    This relates to the brain's difficulty in planning novel motor movements and correctly directing the body during daily activities and play. Students with diffiuclty in this area often "look" as if they want to engage in a game or activity but refuse it, especially if the activity is novel or new.
                </p>
	       </div>

	       <div class="column2of2">
		  
                <h3>POSTURAL DISORDER</h3>

		      <p>
                Postural disorder relates to the students ability to maintain and upright posture while engaging in daily activities. They may often slouch in their seats, exhibit poor core strength, or have unintegrated reflexes. Delays in this area also affect a students oculomotor skills and the ability to move their eyes in a smooth and coordinated manner.

    <section>
	   <h2 id="sdd">SENSORY DISCRIMINATION DISORDER</h2>
	  
       <p>
        Sensory discrimiation disorder relates to incorrect processing of sensory information from the environment. Sensory information can be processed from the 5 external senses and the 2 internal senses. They are divided into the following 6 categories:
        </p>
	
	   <div class="column1of6">
		  <h3>VISUAL</h3>

		  <p>
            Related to vision such as light, scanning of environment, and relationship of objects to each other.
            </p>
	   </div>

	   <div class="column2of6">
		  <h3>AUDITORY</h3>

		  <p>Relates to sound such as volume, frequency, or ability to separate sounds from each other.</p>
	   </div>

	   <div class="column3of6">
		  <h3>TACTILE</h3>

		  <p>Relates to touch sensors such as temperature, pressure, and pain.</p>
	   </div>

	   <div class="column4of6">
		  <h3>TASTE</h3>

		  <p>Relates to gustatory and smell and often affects picky eaters.</p>
	   </div>

	   <div class="column5of6">
		  <h3>MOVEMENT</h3>

		  <p>Relates to the sense of balance and position in space located in the inner ear.</p>
	   </div>

	   <div class="column6of6">
		  <h3>BODY</h3>

		  <p>Relates to sense of muscles and joints and where the body is in relation to objects or other people. Personal space.</p>
